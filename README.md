# Arithmetic Operations Program
# Arithmetic Operations Program üíª

This Python program allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations using two input numbers. The user will input two numbers, and then select an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, or /) to perform on those numbers.

## Features ‚ú®

- Takes user input for two numbers.
- Allows the user to choose an arithmetic operation: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), or division (/).
- Displays the result of the selected operation.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

1. The program prompts the user to enter two integers, `a` and `b`.
2. It then asks the user to choose one of the following operations:
   - **Addition** (`+`) ‚ûï
   - **Subtraction** (`-`) ‚ûñ
   - **Multiplication** (`*`) ‚úñÔ∏è
   - **Division** (`/`) ‚ûó
3. Based on the user's input, the program will calculate and display the result of the chosen operation.
4. If the user enters an invalid operation, the program will notify them.

## Example üìú

```python
Enter value of a: 10
Now enter value of b: 5
Enter your choice +,-,*,/

In this example, the program calculates 10 + 5 and outputs 15.
